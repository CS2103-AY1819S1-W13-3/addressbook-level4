== Project: ConTAct

---

== Overview

ConTAct is a desktop application that is aimed at making a teaching assistant's (TA) job easier. The application provides a variety of features to help the TA with managing students and student contacts.

The application is written is Java, with the Graphical User Interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX. The user interacts with the application through Command-Line Interface (CLI).

* Code Contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=yogtew&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-09&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Report for Contribution]

* *Main Feature Implemented:* Added Attendance feature to ConTAct
** What is does: The attendance feature allows the user to update the attendance of students in their class.
** Justification: This feature is important and useful to the user i.e the TA as it is necessary for a TA to keep track of the attendance of their students and this feature, integrated with the various other features in the application, allows an easy way to do so.
** Highlights: This feature is implemented using the `attendance` command. It allows attendance to be updated in two types of ways. The user can either individually update the attendance of each student in their class or can collectively update the attendance of a whole class and then individually update the students' attendance that does not follow the majority.
** Credits: The initial addressbook-level4 provided a good basis for the implementation of this feature.

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== Marking attendance: `attendance`

Allows the user to mark the attendance of students using the index number as well as mark name. +
Format: `attendance INDEX_NUMBER at/ATTENDANCE` or `attendance m/MARK_NAME at/ATTENDANCE`

****
* The attendance marking as present is done individually, by using the index number of the student, and the user can individually mark students who are absent as 'absent'/'0' and who are present as 'present'/'1'. The user can also collectively mark the attendance using the MARK feature. Then, the user can update the attendance of the students who do not follow the majority specifically.
****

Examples:

* `attendance 1 at/present` +
Marks the attendance of the student with index number 1 as present.

* `attendance 3 at/0` +
Marks the attendance of the student with index number 3 as absent.

* `attendance m/tutorial1 at/1` +
Marks the attendance of all the students in mark-tutorial1 as present.

=== Attendance feature
==== Current Implementation

The `attendance` command is a completely new feature that allows the user to mark the attendance of students
within ConTAct. It follows a similar command flow as that of the address book, and the command will uses the model and
storage of the other commands.
To facilitate this command, a new data type is introduced: the Attendance class.
The Attendance class has it's own unique fields that the user can specify to mark the attendance. The Attendance class
uses another class called the AttendanceEnum class.
This AttendanceEnum class is used to declare the Attendance Enums:PRESENT, ABSENT and UNDEFINED which are then used in the Attendance class.
The attendance class has an overloaded constructor which takes in different parameters.

Field of first constructor:

* Attendance: takes in an AttendanceEnum, can be PRESENT, ABSENT or UNDEFINED

Field of second constructor:

* Attendance: takes in a String attendance, where absent/0 is changed to ABSENT enum, present/1 to PRESENT enum and an empty string is changed to UNDEFINED enum

Currently, the main operation is the `attendance` command, and it is implemented as such:

* `attendance index/INDEX PREFIX_ATTENDANCE/attendance`

The `attendance` command may also be used with the `mark` command to update the attendance of multiple students at the same time. It is implemented as such:

* `attendance PREFIX_MARK/markName PREFIX_ATTENDANCE/attendance`

Currently, this operation exists within the logic component of ConTAct.

Below is an example of how the attendance command behaves:

* `attendance 1 at/0`
* `attendance m/tutorial1 at/1`

This will simply specify the attendance field of the Student/Students with the specified attendance and store it similar to how the addressbook stores a student.
Furthermore, the attendance command ensures that all the fields specified must be valid for it to be a success.

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the attendance command.
