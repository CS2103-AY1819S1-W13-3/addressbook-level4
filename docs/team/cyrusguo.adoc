ConTAct is a desktop application designed to aid teaching assistants by providing them with features that is
catered specifically for their use while still managing to be all-purpose enough to serve a variety of needs.

Tutors interact with the application through the CLI, and the GUI is implemented using JavaFX. The app itself is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* Code Contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=cyrusguo&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-07&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Report]

* *Major enhancement*: added the Graph feature in ConTAct
** What it does: Allows the tutor to graph the attendance and understand the ratio of students present and absent through the use of search keywords or tags.
** Justification: This feature significantly improves the product by offering a means for the tutor to understand the attendance of his classes or groups of students at a glance and take actions if needed.
** Highlights: This feature adds the `graph` command as ways for the user to interact with the graph, while integrating existing commands such as `tag` to be able to search and produce graphs by `tag`. The design considerations were significant to ensure that the calendar was implemented effectively. The graph used has a clean and responsive design. Visually representing the data sets very well.
** Credits: The initial addressbook-level4 provided a good starting platform for the implementation of this feature.
