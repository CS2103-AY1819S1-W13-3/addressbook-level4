== Introduction

ConTAct is an application for teaching assistants who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students*. More importantly, ConTAct is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConTAct can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `conTAct.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ConTAct.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe sn/A98765432 e/johnd@example.com f/School of Computing` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME sn/STUDENT_NUMBER`, `sn/STUDENT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to the address book +
Format: `add n/NAME sn/STUDENT_NUMBER e/EMAIL f/FACULTY [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A student can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/Damith Rajapakse sn/A98765432 e/johnd@example.com f/School of Computing`
* `add n/Bob Ross t/student e/betsycrowe@example.com f/Faculty of Science sn/U1234567 t/physics`

=== Listing all students : `list`

Shows a list of all students in the address book. +
Format: `list`

// tag::email[]
=== Emailing a student: `email`

Allows the user to email a specific student. +
Format: `email INDEX s/SUBJECT b/BODY`

****
* The subject of the email is specified after the s/ and the body after the b/.
* The user can specify one student index, after the `email` command word.
* The user will be redirected to an Outlook sign in page, and has to give consent to allow the application to send the mail on the user's behalf.
****

Examples:

* `email 2 s/Attendance Problem b/Your attendance is poor. Is there a problem?` +
This gathers the email address of the student at index 2, and sets the subject and body respectively. It then asks the user for permission to send the email on their behalf and once the user consents, it sends the email.
// end::email[]

=== Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student in the address book. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [sn/STUDENT_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [f/FACULTY] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the student will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the student's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 sn/A91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the student number and email address of the 1st student to be `A91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd student to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

// tag::attendance[]
=== Marking attendance: `attendance`

Allows the user to mark the attendance of students using the index number as well as group name. +
Format: `attendance INDEX_NUMBER at/ATTENDANCE` or `attendance g/GROUP_NAME at/ATTENDANCE`

* The attendance marking can be done individually, by using the index number of the student.
* The user can also collectively mark the attendance by specifying the `group`. Then, the user can update the attendance of the students who do not follow the majority specifically.
** The group must exist for the user to update the attendance of the group. If the group does not exist, the user needs to create the required group first. See `group` feature on how to create a group of students.
* The user can update the attendance of the student/students who are absent as 'absent' or '0' and who are present as 'present' or '1' (any other value updates the attendance to undefined).
* The existing attendance of the student will be overwritten by the user input values.

Examples:

* `attendance 1 at/present` +
Marks the attendance of the student with index number 1 as present.

* `attendance 3 at/0` +
Marks the attendance of the student with index number 3 as absent.

* `attendance g/tutorial1 at/1` +
Marks the attendance of all the students in group-tutorial1 as present.
// end::attendance[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule events: `schedule`

Schedules an event for the user to keep track of. +
Format: `schedule event/EVENT_NAME date/DATE start/TIME_START end/TIME_END [descr/DESCRIPTION]`

****
* The event will be scheduled and reflected on the user's list of events.
* Events with the same event name, date, start time, and end time, will be considered as duplicates, and will not be scheduled again.
* Invalid dates and times will not be scheduled e.g. `32-12-2018` will not schedule any event. Also, the year range is between 1600 and 9999.
****

Examples:

* `schedule event/CS2103 Tutorial 11 date/14-11-2018 start/13:00 end/14:00 descr/Final Product Demo` +
Schedules an event named `CS2103 Tutorial 11` on 14-11-2018 from 1:00pm to 2:00pm.
+
image::ScheduleExampleForUG.png[width=700]
+
// end::schedule[]

// tag::cancel[]
=== Cancel event: `cancel`

Cancels an event already in the calendar. +
Format: `cancel event/EVENT_NAME date/DATE start/TIME_START end/TIME_END`

****
* The event will be cancelled and be deleted from the user's list of events.
* Like `schedule`, the format is the same, and the event with the exact details must exist within the calendar.
****

Examples:

* `cancel event/CS2103 Consultation date/24-9-2019 start/18:00 end/19:00` +
Cancels the event named `CS2103 Consultation` on 24-9-2019 from 6:00pm to 7:00pm that is present in the calendar.
// end::cancel[]

=== Locating students by name/tag: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Finds students tagged with specified tag. +
Format: `find t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]`

****
* Tags are case sensitive
* The order of the tags does not matter
* Students matching at least one tag will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any student having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`
* `find t/students` +
Returns students tagged with `t/students`
* `find t/students t/colleagues` +
Returns students tagged with `t/students` or `t/colleagues`

// tag::group[]
=== Group: `group`
A `Group` represents a group of `Students` in the app. Some commands accept `Groups` as an alternative to `INDEX` as a parameter to perform batch operations instead of individual operations.

==== Group Creation
Format: `group [g/grpName] find t/TAGNAME` or `group [g/grpName] find KEYWORD`

This creates a Group containing the Students returned by the find command with the supplied arguments.

`group find t/friends` will find all students in the Address Book tagged with "friends" and add them to a group.

* [v2.0] `group index INDEX...` will take a series of indices as arguments and group the students represented by the indices
```
// assume that the current display shows {Adam, Bob, Charles, Dylan}
group g/grp1 index 1 4
// g/grp1 will then contain {Adam, Dylan} since Adam is index 1 and Dylan is index 4 on the currently displayed list
```

==== Named Groups
Groups can be named by using the prefix `g/GROUPNAME`. If not specified, the name of the created Group will default to "g/default",
i.e. `group find t/friends` is equivalent to `group g/default find t/friends`

E.g. `group g/myGroupName find t/friends` will add the Students tagged with "friends" to a Group called "myGroupName"

Note: Group names must be alphanumeric and not contain spaces.


==== Manipulating Groups
Groups are able to be manipulated to expand or contract the selection to fit the users needs

* `join` will take two groups as arguments and create a new group that contains students from either of the groups
```
// assume that g/grp1 contains {Adam, Bob}
// g/grp2 contains {Bob, Charles}
group g/grp3 join g/grp1 g/grp2
// g/grp3 will contain {Adam, Bob, Charles}
```

* `and` will take two groups as arguments and create a new group that contains only students that are in both of the groups
```
// assume that g/grp1 contains {Adam, Bob}
// g/grp2 contains {Bob, Charles}
group g/grp3 and g/grp1 g/grp2
// g/grp3 will contain {Bob} since Bob is the only student in g/grp1 and g/grp2
```

* [v2.0] `complement` will take one groups as an argument and create a new group that contains every student except those in the supplied group
```
// assume that there are a total of 3 entries, {Adam, Bob, Charles}
// and g/grp1 contains {Bob}
group g/grp2 complement g/grp1
// g/grp2 will then contain {Adam, Charles} since Bob is in g/grp1 and will thus be excluded
```

General format: `group [g/DEST_GROUP] <operation> g/OPERANDGROUP1 [g/OPERANDGROUP2]`

Note: The first operand is compulsory while the second operand is optional and will default to "g/default"

==== Displaying Groups
The Students in a Group can be shown in the GUI with the following command:

`group [g/GROUPTOBESHOWN] show`

==== Interactions with `undo` and `redo`
Due to the way `undo` and `redo` are implemented, Groups that are changed as a result of these commands will not behave as expected, the students that are changed will be removed from the Group.

For example,
```
// g/grp1 contains {Adam, Bob}
delete 1 // delete Adam
// g/grp1 will now only contain {Bob}
undo // restores Adam to the addressbook
// g/grp1 will not be restored to the previous state and will still only contain {Bob}
```

==== Reference
(Implemented as of 1.4)

* `group [g/grp1] find <KEYWORD|t/TAG...>` -- finds persons matching KEYWORD in their name or matching specified tags and group under _grp1_
* `group [g/grp1] join g/grp2 g/grp3` -- groups the *union* of _grp2_ and _grp3_ under _grp1_
* `group [g/grp1] and g/grp2 g/grp3` -- groups the *intersection* of _grp2_ and _grp3_ under _grp1_
* `group [g/grp1] show` -- displays students from _grp1_ in the GUI

Notes:

* g/grp1 defaults to _default_ if omitted

Examples:

* `group find t/friends` -- adds all students with tag _t/friends_ under _g/default_
* `group g/abc find t/colleagues` -- groups all students with tag _t/colleagues_ under _g/abc_
* `group join g/a g/b` -- groups students in either _g/a_ or _g/b_ under _g/default_ (union of a and b)
* `group and g/a g/b` -- groups students in both _g/a_ and _g/b_ under _g/default_ (intersection of a and b)
* `group g/test show` -- shows students grouped under _g/test_ in the GUI
// end::group[]

// tag::cmdtag[]
=== Tag Students: `tag`
Adds, sets or deletes tags from students (by index or by name).

Format: `tag add|set|del index|g/group [t/tags...]`

Examples:
```
tag add 1 t/tut1 // Adds the tag "tut1" to first person in list
tag set 1 t/tut1 // Removes all tags from first person in list and adds tag "tut1"
tag del 1 t/tut1 // Removes the tag "tut1" to first person in list (does not do anything if supplied tag is not found)

tag add g/students t/cs2103 // Adds the tag "cs2103" to all students in the group named "students"
```

Note:

* The command accepts any number of tags (including 0), using `tag set` with no tags supplied will clear all tags
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is already present in the case of `tag add` and `tag set`
* The command will not fail even if the supplied tag is absent in the case of `tag delete`
* The command will still display a success message if the above cases occur
// end::cmdtag[]
